## rendu 1

E1 : Rate-1/2 convolutional encoder, generator polynomial G = (1 + D^2, 1 + D + D^2 )

X_QPSK : QPSK with a Gray mapping

Simulation of the BER vs E_b/N_0 for the coded system and uncoded system with E1 and X_QPSK modulation. Use of an hard reciever.

### part 1

E2 : Rate-1/2 convolutional encoder, generator polynomial G = (1 + D^2 + D^3 + D^4, 1 + D^2 + D^3 )

Simulation of the BER vs E_b/N_0 for the coded system and uncoded system with E2 and X_QPSK modulation. Use of an hard reciever and a soft reciever.

### part 2

E3 : Rate-1/2 convolutional encoder, generator polynomial G = (1 + D^3 + D^4, 1 + D + D^3 + D^4 )

Simulation of the BER vs E_b/N_0 for the coded system and uncoded system with E1, E2, E3 and X_QPSK modulation. Use of a soft reciever.


### part 3

Simulation of the BER vs E_b/N_0 for the coded system and uncoded system with E3 and X_BPSK, E3 and X_QPSK gray, E3 and E4 and X_AMPM modulation. Use of a soft reciever.
Code might not be all be 100% right for X_AMPM.
